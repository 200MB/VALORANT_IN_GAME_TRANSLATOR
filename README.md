# VALORANT IN GAME TRANSLATOR
This is a valorant in game chat translator written in java.

ever get tired of getting matched with people who dont speak your language? i know i do. so i decided to create a program that will autotranslate 
whatever they type in chat and send a translated version right back to me.

my goal is to make this as easy and user friendly as possible. all you have to do is open valorant first and then open the translator thats it.
everything else is automated. (well you will have to input your preffered language for program to translate into)


DISCLAIMER: this project is still in early development and i have yet to contact riot games about this project to see if they'll allow such thing.
program still needs optimizations and even after it finally gets finished please wait for my confirmation because it might be bannable it is a neccessary
step for me to ask valorant support. 

the good news is that i highly doubt this will be the case since this program doesn't access valorant in-game memory AT ALL meaning that anti-cheat will not get
triggered.
